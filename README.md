# Dart bundle for TextMate / Sublime

This bundle provides rules to TextMate that describe minimal rules for display of the
Dart source code. At this point the dart bundle provides:

* syntax highlighting of keywords
* syntax highlighting of strings
* Preferences for comments so that you can use CMD-/ to (de)comment source lines.

The bundle identifies dart source by the file extension (.dart).

INSTALLATION
============

From the command line. From the root of the dart repo, type:
open tools/utils/Dart.tmbundle

-OR-
From TextMate:
Open (File->Open...) the Dart.tmbundle file

-OR-
For use with Sublime Text:
Copy Dart.tmbundle to the sublime packages directory (on OSX: 
~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages).

For the best Sublime experience, make sure the `dart-sdk/bin` directory is on
your path. Also, add the `dartsdk_path` variable to your user settings:

    {
      "dartsdk_path" : "/Users/foo/dart-sdk"  
    }
